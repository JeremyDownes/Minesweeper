## Minesweeper React

This app is pretty self-explanatory. Credit to the authors of Codecademy resources for the Minesweeper class definition. 
I'm going to leave this one alone for awhile in the hopes that someone will be inspired to take the next step
to improve on the function of this classic game. Any one who is interested should feel free to fork and tweek.
I'd like to see:

* Images, animations, possibly sounds added
* UI options. Colors, square styles... something creative
* Square boxes. The squares should be square despite the screen / game dimensions.
  I can think of a couple ways of implementing this but maybe someone else wants a challenge
* Zero value reveal. Clicking once on a zero value square should reveal all adjacent zero value squares.
  Again I have an idea of how to do it and if no one else jumps on it I may revisit it. 
* Plant flag. Remember from the Windows 98 game? I'd like to see a drag and drop JS implementation in React.
